# simple-game
This code is for a simple game done with the Unity framework. A ball will move forward on a track where players need to press "a" to move left or "d" to move right in order to avoid colliding with several obstacules on the track. An initial view is shown to players with a button to start the game. The 1st Game is displayed to players after pressing the Start button. If they succeed, they will move on to the 2nd Game and the 3rd Game. Otherwise, if players hit an obstacle or fall off the track they will start on the same level again. At last, after finishing with the three levels available to players, a final scene is displayed before exiting the game.
